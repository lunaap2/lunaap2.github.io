# JuanS3 - Personal Portfolio

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website, accessible at [juans3.github.io](https://juans3.github.io).

This project was originally based on the [AstroZen](https://github.com/immois/astro-zen) template.

## ✨ Features

- Minimalist, clean, and simple design
- Mobile-first responsive layout
